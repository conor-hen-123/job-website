# job-website

Job Website using Java EE
Job providers can post jobs, accept freelancers and pay freelancers virtual tokens. Freelancers can
create profiles and search/apply for jobs. The user interface was created using JSF. The server-side
logic was implemented using EJB components. A GlassFish Server is used while jobs and users are
stored in a Java DB (Derby) database.
